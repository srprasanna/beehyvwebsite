            <td width="486" align="left" valign="top"><p class="Page_main_text">The quality of the people working on developing your product is the most   important criteria that can have a tremendous bearing on the success of your   product, because product development requires highly skilled   personnel.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>Education:</strong><br>
              While looking for your OPD   partner, especially in India, watch out for the academic background of the   people they employ. In a country like India, where millions of people become   engineers every year, the credentials of the institutions from where they   graduate are important. Graduates (B.Tech's) from Indian Institute of Technology   (IIT), form the cream layer. The alumni from IIT's are highly successful across   the globe and have proven themselves in various fields. A team consisting of IIT   graduates would be your best bet in launching world class   products.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Work experience:</strong><br>
              What kind of work exposure   do the employees of the OPD partner firm have? Have they worked with software   products or with software applications? Have they worked with customers from   across the world? Software product development requires a much higher level of   skill sets compared to software application development and it is much more   technically challenging to write world class products. You can handpick the   firms who have people who can claim to have developed world class products. Your   OPD partner firm should have people who have been involved extensively in   software product development in various roles so that it can fully take on the   responsibility of building a world class product for   you.<br>
              <br>
              <strong>Innovative mindset:</strong><br>
              Many a time, the   requirements for product development are known only at a high level, because you   are innovating all the time. Your OPD partner's team should have the capability   to evolve the design of your product's features by <br>
              - interacting with   customers, prospects, technical peers, etc.<br>
              - researching on new developments   in the technical field as well as by being aware of what the competition is   doing.<br>
              - trying out a couple of solutions by building prototypes and choosing   the best solution.</p>
              <p class="Page_main_text"><br>
                  <strong>Solid technical skills:</strong><br>
                The design of the software   product entails a lot of attention to the details. It is the responsibility of   the technical lead of your OPD partner's firm to make use of the best practices   in the industry for designing a solution. In a software application, the code   and application is not distributed across multiple customers; whereas, in a   product, the code is distributed to multiple customers. Scalability of the   product is extremely crucial while designing the product. If that is not taken   into account, it involves a lot of re-write and introduces a lot of errors. Your   OPD partner firm should have technical leads that are extremely well versed and   comfortable with technology. You'll know when you talk to   one!<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Partners:</strong><br>
                You should look for an OPD "partner"   firm and not just an outsourcing firm. Your OPD partner's team should be able to   provide valuable inputs and suggestions on your product along the way. They   should be actively involved in improving the process of development, the quality   of the product and should suggest innovations in your product. They should be   passionate about your product. They should be your peers.</p>
              <p class="Page_main_text"><strong>Process:<br>
                    <br>
                SDLC   for product development:</strong><br>
                The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)   for product management is very different from the SDLC followed for application   development. Many software consulting firms today are SEI CMM or ISO certified.   These certifications definitely carry value but only if they are used   appropriately. Very often these compliance standards are not adapted to suit the   situation at hand, they are followed blindly. Following too much of these   standards would kill your product.</p>
              <p class="Page_main_text">You should choose an OPD partner who understands the difference between the   process for product development and application development. The process   followed by your OPD firm should be agile and adaptable to meet the challenges   due the competition as well as market demand. Product firms work on multiple   releases at a time and that should be factored into the SDLC followed by your   OPD firm.<strong><br>
                    <br>
                Configuration management for a multi release   environment:</strong><br>
                Software product development is characterized by   simultaneous development for multiple releases and service packs, probably in   different locations. In fact, the more mature a product is and the more   customers it has, it is highly likely that different customers are on different   releases. Hence, you need to maintain the code for all the releases until all   your customers have been migrated from the previous releases. In such a   scenario, it is extremely important to understand and implement a configuration   management process that enables simultaneous development on releases without   causing conflicts and maintenance nightmares. Only people who have worked with   multiple products understand the intricacies of multi release management. Hence   it is important that you choose an OPD partner whose people are experienced in   software product development.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>IP protection and   security:</strong><br>
                Protection of IP and trade secrets is undoubtedly   essential for the survival of a software product firm. While choosing your OPD   partner, you've to ensure that your contract covers all these aspects. You   should also make sure that your OPD partner has the appropriate safeguards in   its contracts with its employees. You should also ensure that your OPD partner   has good networking and physical security. </p>
              <p class="Page_main_text"><strong>Product management:</strong></p>
              <p class="Page_main_text"><strong>Release management experience:</strong><br>
                In a typical product firm,   work goes on simultaneously for multiple releases. There are multiple releases   in a year and there could be service packs for each release. Work goes on at a   feverish pace at all times of the year in a product firm. You require a product   manager who has been there, done that. The product manager should be able to   accommodate scope creep with minimum impact on the timelines, because scope   creeps are unavoidable during product development. <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Market   analysis and research:</strong><br>
                The OPD firm should have product managers who   are experienced to assist you in doing market research and competitive analysis.   They should have successfully executed a few major and minor releases of a good   product. They should always keep the pulse of the market and give you valuable   suggestions to streamline your strategy.</p>
              <p class="Page_main_text"><strong>Hiring and keeping top talent:</strong><br>
                It is the responsibility   of the product manager to hire and retain top talent. It'll be useful to be   aware of the recruiting policy and methodology of your OPD partner firm.<br>
              </p>
              <p class="Page_main_text"><strong>Customer support:</strong></p>
              <p class="Page_main_text"><strong>Product support:</strong><br>
                Your OPD partner should have people with   experience in supporting products that have been in the market and who   understand the importance of complying to SLA's (Service Level Agreements) with   customers. They should have people who've been on the hot seat.</p>
              <p class="Page_main_text"><strong>Professional services:</strong><br>
                Your OPD partner should be able   provide training on your product. They should also be able to integrate your   product into the software systems of your customers. This might require that the   personnel from your OPD partner firm travel to the customer site. They should   have the experience of working with customers across the globe, have good   communication skills and the experience of understanding the requirements and   working on enterprise applications. They should be able to represent your   product when talking to customers. The people working with your customers should   have good credentials. An education from a top institute like IIT (Indian   Institute of Technology) will definitely boost the resume.</p>
