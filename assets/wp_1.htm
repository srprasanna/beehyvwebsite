            <td width="486" align="left" valign="top"><p class="Page_main_text">Software Product Companies of late have been discovering the huge advantages   of outsourced product development (OPD). Until recently, software product   development was considered one of the core competencies of a software product   company. Why, then, has the trend changed towards outsourcing? <br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>Let’s look at some of the reasons:</strong></p>
              <p class="Page_main_text">• Software product companies are beginning to realize that their core focus   should be on identifying market opportunities, innovation, aligning the vision   of the company with the market requirements, refining the roadmap and most   important of all, marketing.</p>
              <p class="Page_main_text">• Startup software product companies have expertise about their business   vertical but they don't have an engineering team setup. Time is of essence for   startup firms, OPD allows the startup firms to jumpstart their product   development without building an engineering team first. The OPD vendor can   transition development to the startup’s in-house development team after a couple   of releases of the product or build the development team for the startup.   Building an in-house engineering team and maintaining that team is a   time-consuming activity and saps the company’s energy. The company loses its   focus on the market.</p>
              <p class="Page_main_text">• For already established software product firms, the challenge is to keep up   with the market and the competition. Time-to-market is the key to success since   any product has a limited time window to capitalize on the market and make   profits. This is even more pronounced with the move towards global economy and   competition from vendors across the world.</p>
              <p class="Page_main_text">OPD allows the product firm to rapidly mobilize the development team skilled   in product development and scale up its operations depending on the market   demand. It enables them to pack more features into the product release and   shorten the product release timelines, thus reducing time-to-market.</p>
              <p class="Page_main_text">• Many OPD firms operate out of countries like India where you get excellent   talent at a very reasonable cost. It reduces the cost of development   substantially.</p>
              <p class="Page_main_text">• A product is not just the software. It is imperative to certify it for   quality; have excellent documentation to support the product; prepare training   material for the new product; make marketing collaterals to sell the product;   and support the product. The people involved in these activities need to work   closely with the development team and they have to be managed. The OPD firm   removes the burden of execution from the product firm and lets it focus on its   core. OPD firms operating in India have people who can communicate fluently in   English, which is imperative for most of the activities.</p>
              <p class="Page_main_text">• A software product firm needs an excellent presales team that understands   the product well, interacts with prospective customers, analyzes their needs and   prepares demos for them. A good OPD partner based in India can provide quality   technical personnel having a wide exposure to software systems and good   communication skills at a low cost.</p>
              <p class="Page_main_text">• Software product firms need to provide professional services for the   customers of their product. Customers need to be trained on the product and they   need assistance in integrating the product into their software environment. An   OPD partner, based in low cost centers like India, can provide an efficient   onshore/offshore model that brings down the professional services cost for the   customer and at the same time increases the profit margins for the software   product firm.</p>
              <p class="Page_main_text">• Software development is the core skill of OPD firms. They have the   experience in this field. They are familiar with the best patterns and practices   for development. They are up to date on technology in this fast-changing world.   This cuts down the costs involved in re-training employees when the technology   of choice changes. Software product development requires a higher level of skill   as opposed to software application development. The OPD firms possess that   talent. Venture capital firms definitely feel more comfortable if the plan is to   outsource software development to the people who know it best.<br>
              </p>
              <p class="Page_main_text">To summarize, OPD reduces the cost of development and allows the software   product firm to focus on growing the business. It reduces the burden of   execution from the software product firm Development substantially..<br>
